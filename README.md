# generate-numbers-to-sum-100

This script **prints n numbers to the console that equal 100**.

## Overview

I made this script because I wanted to generate pseudo-random demographic breakdowns for a worldbuilding project. I created this script to give me n numbers that, when added, would equal 100%.

## How to use

You must have at least Python 3.6.5 to use this script.

1. Open a command-line interface.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. In a text editor, edit how many numbers you want the script to return.
4. Run the script by typing `python3 generate-numbers-to-sum-100.py` (Mac / Linux) or `python generate-numbers-to-sum-100.py` (Windows).
